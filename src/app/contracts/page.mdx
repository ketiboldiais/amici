# Contracts
## Applicable Law
* Before analyzing a contract issue, a court must determine which law applies.
* The __Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)__ governs contracts for the sale of goods.
	+ A __good__ is any movable or tangible property.
* __Common law__ governs all other contracts.
	+ Commonly, such contracts include __contracts for services__, __contracts for real property__, and __marriage contracts__ (i.e., “prenups”).
* ~Predominance Test~. If a contract includes both goods and the provision of services, then the contract’s predominant purpose as a whole and the law governing that purpose determines the applicable law.
	- _Example._ ${A}$ and ${B}$ sign a contract ${C,}$ where ${A}$ agrees to purchase raw steel from ${B.}$ Most of the contract concerns how and when ${A}$ purchases the raw steel, but there is a single provision where ${B}$ agrees to also provide a service for testing the processed steel’s malleability. Because the primary purpose of ${C}$ is to purchase raw steel – a good – the UCC controls under the predominance test.

## Types of Contracts
- A __bilateral contract__ is a contract where both parties make promises to perform.
- A __unilateral contract__ is a contract where the offeror makes a promise in exchange for the offeree˚s actual performance.

## Contract Formation
* A contract is valid only if it is based on __mutual assent__.
* A contract is based on mutual assent only if there exists (1) an __offer__, (2) __acceptance__, and (3) __consideration__.

### Offer
#### Common Law Offers
* At common law, an offer is a __manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain__. The party making the offer is called the __offeror__, and the party receiving the offer is called the __offeree__. 
* To show a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, the offeror must demonstrate __intent to enter into a contract__ – on __definite and certain terms__ – with a __communication to the offeree__.
	- ~Showing Intent.~ Whether this requirement is a met is a question of fact – the party arguing that the requirement is met must present evidence supporting their claim.
		+ ~Language.~ The offeror’s language is often used to establish intent (e.g., “I offer”). Courts will use an __objective standard__ to determine whether the language shows intent: Would a reasonable person interpret the language as an offeror intending to make an offer?
		+ ~Context.~ Even if the offeror’s language is explicit, the language must be interpreted in context.
			+ ~Jokes.~ An offer made as a joke – called an __offer in jest__ – is not a valid offer.
			+ ~Preliminary Negotiations.~ A court will also consider the timing of the offeror’s language. The language could be an invitation to negotiate, rather than an explicit offer (e.g., “I’m thinking of selling my ranch,” or “I’d consider taking ${\text{\textdollar}30,000}$ for the truck.”)
			+ ~Advertisements.~ An advertisement is considered an invitation to deal.
				- ~Exception.~ An advertisement is a valid offer if (1) the advertisement contains __words of commitment__ and (2) from the advertisement, an offeree can be identified with __specificity__.  
			+ ~Catalogs.~ Like advertisements, a catalog with specific goods and prices is considered an invitation to deal, rather than an offer.
		+ ~Special Case: Auctions.~ A reward or an auction bid is an offer only if it is clear who can accept or win.
	- ~Showing Definite and Certain Terms.~ An offer contains “definite and certain terms” only if the content of its underlying bargain can be determined and enforced. In particular, courts will look to see if the following terms are present:
		1. ~Quantity.~ How many goods are sold or how long services will be provided must be stated or ascertainable.
		2. ~Timing of performance.~ When goods must be sold by, or when the provision of services must commence, must be stated or ascertainble. If this term is absent, the court may supply – i.e., assume – the term as a “reasonable time.”
		3. ~Identification.~ The parties to the contract must be identified.
		4. ~Price.~ For real estate contracts (contracts for the sale of land), a price must always be stated. For goods under the UCC: If an explicit price is absent, the court may assume a “reasonable price at the time of delivery.”
		5. ~Subject matter.~ The contract’s purpose – i.e., what the contract is about – must be identified clearly. 
	- ~Showing communication to the offeree.~ A communication to the offeree is made only if the offeree has knowledge of the offer. 

#### UCC Offers
- In general, the UCC takes a more liberal approach to offers – inviting acceptance in __any manner__ and by __any reasonable medium__ under the circumstances is a valid offer. Where terms are absent, the UCC provides _gap fillers_ for courts to use.
- That said, there are two contract terms the UCC does not provide gap fillers for (and therefore, must always be stated explicitly): (1) Subject matter and (2) quantity.

### Terminating Offers
- There are two ways to terminate an offer: (1) rejection and (2) revocation.

#### Rejection
- An offer is terminated if the offeree makes an outright rejection of the offer.
- There are two ways to perform a rejection:
	1. ~Express rejection.~ If the offeree states that they do not intend to accept the offer, then the offeree rejects the offer and the offer terminates.[^express_rejection]
	2. ~Counteroffer.~ If the offeree responds to the offer with an offer of their own that contains the same subject matter as the original offer but differs in its terms, then the offeree rejects the original offer and makes a new offer.[^counter_offer]
		- ~Distinguish Inquiries.~ Inquiring about an alternative deal is not a counteroffer. E.g., “Would you take less than ...?” is considered an inquiry.

[^express_rejection]: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 36.
[^counter_offer]: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 39.

#### Revocation
- An offeror can revoke (i.e., “cancel”) an __ordinary offer__ at any time before acceptance. If the offeror revokes their offer, then the offeree no longer has the power to accept.
- A revocation can be direct or indirect.
	1. ~Direct Revocation.~ E.g., the offeror states, “That offer is no longer on the table”. 
	3. ~Indirect Revocation.~ A third party communicates the offeror’s revocation.
		- The offeror’s words or conduct imply a revocation (e.g., selling the goods offered to another party). In the case or words or conduct, the offeree must be aware of the words or conduct.

##### Limitations on Revocation 
- The rules for revocations only apply to ordinary offers.

###### Irrevocable Offers 
- Some offers are __irrevocable offers__, which include:
	1. __UCC firm offers__. An offer is considered a firm offer under the UCC only if:
		1. The offer is made by a merchant.
		2. The offer is in writing. 
		3. The offer is signed.
		4. The offeror assures the offeree that the offer will be held open for a specified time. During that time, the offer is irrevocable.
		5. The specified time must be three months or less. 
			- Even if the offeror states that the offer will remain open for longer than three months, under the law, it will only be irrevocable for three months. The offer, however, is not automatically revoked after three months. The offeror cannot revoke the offer in the first three months, but after three months, the offeror can revoke his offer (even if he assured the offeree for a time period longer than three months). If the offeror does not revoke his offer, the offer remains open and can still be accepted.
	2. __Option Contracts.__ 
		- An _option contract_ is a contract where the offeror promises the offeree that they will keep the offer available for acceptance within a specified time period (called the _option period_). Consideration is required for an option contract. During the option period, the offer cannot be revoked.

###### Detrimental Reliance & Partial Performance
- An offer is temporarily irrevocable if (a) the offeree has prepared to perform in reasonable detrimental reliance on the offer, or (b) the offeree has partly performed.

###### Lapse of Time 
- The offeror can set a time limit for acceptance.
- If no time limit is provided, then the offer remains open only for a “reasonable” time.
- Once the time to accept has passed, the offeree cannot accept the offer.
- __Special case: Oral offers.__ An oral offer lapses at the end of the conversation.

###### Death or Incapacity 
- If the offeror or offeree dies or loses legal capcity to enter into a contract, there is no power to accept.

### Acceptance 
- An acceptance is the manifestation of assent to the terms of the offer.
- The manifestation of assent may be found through oral or written communications (creating an _express contract_), or by conduct (creating an _implied-in-fact contract_).
- Because the offeror is the _master of the offer_, the offeror determines how his offer can be accepted.

#### Limitations on Acceptance
- ~Time Limits.~ The offeree must accept the offer by the offeror’s deadline. If no deadline is provided, the offeree must accept the offer within a “reasonable time.”
- ~Who May Accept.~ The only person who may accept the offer is the party to whom the offer is directed.
- ~Knowledge of the Offer.~ The offeree must know of the offer before accepting.
- ~Manner of Acceptance.~ An offer must be accepted according to the offeror’s prescribed method. If the offeror does not prescribe a method, then the acceptance must be done by “reasonable means.”

#### When Is an Acceptance Effective?
- If the offer contains terms stating when acceptance occurs, then such terms control.
- If the offer does not state when acceptance occurs, then the following rules apply.
	1. An option contract is effective the moment the offeree receives the contract.
	2. ~Mailbox Rule~. Acceptance occurs at __proper dispatch__ – when offeree no longer has control or possession of the acceptance (e.g., when the offeree mails a letter communicating their acceptance).
