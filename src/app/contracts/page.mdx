# Contracts
## Applicable Law
* Before analyzing a contract issue, a court must determine which law applies.
* The **_Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)_** governs contracts for the sale of goods.
	+ A **_good_** is any movable or tangible property.
* Common law governs all other contracts.
	+ Commonly, such contracts include contracts for services, contracts for real property, and marriage contracts (i.e., “prenups”).
* ~Predominance Test~. If a contract includes both goods and the provision of services, then the contract’s predominant purpose as a whole and the law governing that purpose determines the applicable law.
	- _Example._ ${A}$ and ${B}$ sign a contract ${C,}$ where ${A}$ agrees to purchase raw steel from ${B.}$ Most of the contract concerns how and when ${A}$ purchases the raw steel, but there is a single provision where ${B}$ agrees to also provide a service for testing the processed steel’s malleability. Because the primary purpose of ${C}$ is to purchase raw steel – a good – the UCC controls under the predominance test.

## Types of Contracts
- A **_bilateral contract_** is a contract where both parties make promises to perform.
- A **_unilateral contract_** is a contract where the offeror makes a promise in exchange for the offeree’s actual performance.

## Contract Formation
* A contract is valid only if it is based on **_mutual assent_**.
* A contract is based on mutual assent only if there exists (1) an **_offer_**, (2) **_acceptance_**, and (3) **_consideration_**.

### Offer
#### Common Law Offers
* At common law, an offer is a **_manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain_**. The party making the offer is called the **_offeror_**, and the party receiving the offer is called the **_offeree_**. 

#### Limitations on Offers 
* To show a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain, the offeror must demonstrate **_intent to enter into a contract_** – on **_definite and certain terms_** – with a **_communication to the offeree_**.

##### Intent to Contract
- Whether a party intends to contract is a question of fact – the party arguing that there was intent must present evidence supporting their claim.
- ~Language~. The offeror’s language is often used to establish intent (e.g., “I offer”). Courts will use an **_objective standard_** to determine whether the language shows intent: Would a reasonable person interpret the language as an offeror intending to make an offer?
- ~Context~. Even if the offeror’s language is explicit, the language must be interpreted in context.
- ~Jokes.~ An offer made as a joke – called an **_offer in jest_** – is not a valid offer.
- ~Preliminary Negotiations.~ A court will also consider the timing of the offeror’s language. The language could be an invitation to negotiate, rather than an explicit offer (e.g., “I’m thinking of selling my ranch,” or “I’d consider taking ${\text{\textdollar}30,000}$ for the truck.”)
- ~Advertisement.~ An advertisement is considered an invitation to deal.
- ~Exception.~ An advertisement is a valid offer if (1) the advertisement contains words of commitment and (2) from the advertisement, an offeree can be identified with specificity.  
- ~Catalogs.~ Like advertisements, a catalog with specific goods and prices is considered an invitation to deal, rather than an offer.
-  ~Auctions~. A reward or an auction bid is an offer only if it is clear who can accept or win.

##### Definite and Certain Terms
- An offer contains “definite and certain terms” only if the content of its underlying bargain can be determined and enforced. In particular, courts will look to see if the following terms are present:
	1. ~Quantity.~ How many goods are sold or how long services will be provided must be stated or ascertainable.
	2. ~Timing of performance.~ When goods must be sold by, or when the provision of services must commence, must be stated or ascertainble. If this term is absent, the court may supply – i.e., assume – the term as a “reasonable time.”
	3. ~Identification.~ The parties to the contract must be identified.
	4. ~Price.~ For real estate contracts (contracts for the sale of land), a price must always be stated. For goods under the UCC: If an explicit price is absent, the court may assume a “reasonable price at the time of delivery.”
	5. ~Subject matter.~ The contract’s purpose – i.e., what the contract is about – must be identified clearly. 

##### Communication to the Offeree 
- A communication to the offeree is made only if the offeree has knowledge of the offer. 

#### UCC Offers
- In general, the UCC takes a more liberal approach to offers – inviting acceptance in any manner and by any reasonable medium under the circumstances is a valid offer. Where terms are absent, the UCC provides **_gap fillers_** for courts to use.
- That said, there are two contract terms the UCC does not provide gap fillers for (and therefore, must always be stated explicitly): (1) Subject matter and (2) quantity.

### Terminating Offers
- There are two ways to terminate an offer: (1) rejection and (2) revocation.

#### Rejection
- An offer is terminated if the offeree makes an outright rejection of the offer.
- There are two ways to perform a rejection:
	1. ~Express rejection.~ If the offeree states that they do not intend to accept the offer, then the offeree rejects the offer and the offer terminates.[^express_rejection]
	2. ~Counteroffer.~ If the offeree responds to the offer with an offer of their own that contains the same subject matter as the original offer but differs in its terms, then the offeree rejects the original offer and makes a new offer.[^counter_offer]
		- ~Distinguish Inquiries.~ Inquiring about an alternative deal is not a counteroffer. E.g., “Would you take less than ...?” is considered an inquiry.

[^express_rejection]: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 36.
[^counter_offer]: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 39.

#### Revocation
- An offeror can revoke (i.e., “cancel”) an **_ordinary offer_** at any time before acceptance. If the offeror revokes their offer, then the offeree no longer has the power to accept.
- A revocation can be direct or indirect.
	1. ~Direct Revocation.~ E.g., the offeror states, “That offer is no longer on the table”. 
	3. ~Indirect Revocation.~ A third party communicates the offeror’s revocation.
		- The offeror’s words or conduct imply a revocation (e.g., selling the goods offered to another party). In the case or words or conduct, the offeree must be aware of the words or conduct.

##### Limitations on Revocation 
- The rules for revocations only apply to ordinary offers.

###### Irrevocable Offers
- Not all offers are ordinary offers–some offers are **_irrevocable offers_**, which include:
	1. ~UCC Firm Offers.~ An offer is a _UCC firm offer_ only if:
		1. The offer is made by a merchant.
		2. The offer is in writing. 
		3. The offer is signed.
		4. The offeror assures the offeree that the offer will be held open for a specified time. During that time, the offer is irrevocable.
		5. The specified time must be three months or less. 
			- Even if the offeror states that the offer will remain open for longer than three months, under the law, it will only be irrevocable for three months. The offer, however, is not automatically revoked after three months. The offeror cannot revoke the offer in the first three months, but after three months, the offeror can revoke his offer (even if he assured the offeree for a time period longer than three months). If the offeror does not revoke his offer, the offer remains open and can still be accepted.
	2. ~Option Contracts.~ An **_option contract_** is a contract where the offeror promises the offeree that they will keep the offer available for acceptance within a specified time period (called the _option period_). Consideration is required for an option contract. During the option period, the offer cannot be revoked.

###### Detrimental Reliance & Partial Performance
- An offer is temporarily irrevocable if (a) the offeree has prepared to perform in reasonable detrimental reliance on the offer, or (b) the offeree has partly performed.

###### Lapse of Time
- The offeror can set a time limit for acceptance.
- If no time limit is provided, then the offer remains open only for a “reasonable” time.
- Once the time to accept has passed, the offeree cannot accept the offer.

###### Oral Offers
- An oral offer lapses at the end of the conversation.

###### Death or Incapacity
- If the offeror or offeree dies or loses legal capcity to enter into a contract, there is no power to accept.

### Acceptance 
- An acceptance is the manifestation of assent to the terms of the offer.
- The manifestation of assent may be found through oral or written communications (creating an _express contract_), or by conduct (creating an _implied-in-fact contract_).
- Because the offeror is the _master of the offer_, the offeror determines how his offer can be accepted.

#### Limitations on Acceptance
- ~Time Limits.~ The offeree must accept the offer by the offeror’s deadline. If no deadline is provided, the offeree must accept the offer within a “reasonable time.”
- ~Who May Accept.~ The only person who may accept the offer is the party to whom the offer is directed.
- ~Knowledge of the Offer.~ The offeree must know of the offer before accepting.
- ~Manner of Acceptance.~ An offer must be accepted according to the offeror’s prescribed method. If the offeror does not prescribe a method, then the acceptance must be done by “reasonable means.”

#### When Is an Acceptance Effective?
- If the offer contains terms stating when acceptance occurs, then such terms control.
- If the offer does not state when acceptance occurs, then the following rules apply.
	1. An option contract is effective the moment the offeree receives the contract.
	2. ~Mailbox Rule~. Acceptance occurs at **_proper dispatch_** – when offeree no longer has control or possession of the acceptance (e.g., when the offeree mails a letter communicating their acceptance).
		- If both an acceptance and a rejection are sent, then the following rules apply:
			1. If the acceptance is dispatched first, then the acceptance is effective.
			2. If the rejection is dispatched first, then the acceptance is effective only if the offeror receives the acceptance first.
			
#### Acceptance Deviating from the Offer
- Under the common law **_mirror image rule_**, an offeree’s response to an offer is an acceptance only if (1) the response does not conflict with the offer’s terms, and (2) the response does not add new terms to the offer. So, if the offeree responds to the offer with details that conflict with the offer, or the offeree responds to the offer with additional terms, then no acceptance occurs. 
- Under the UCC, any “expression of acceptance” or “written confirmation” is an acceptance, even if the expression or writing contains different or additional terms.
	- ~Exception~. If the offeree states that their acceptance is conditioned on the offeror assenting to additional or different terms, then no acceptance occurs until the offeror assents to the additional or different terms.
	- ~Special Treatment of Additional Terms.~ If the offeree responds with an acceptance including additional terms, then a **_battle of the forms_** occurs:
		1. If any party is not a merchant, then each additional term is considered a proposal and does not become a part of the contract unless the other party assents to the additional term.
		2. If all parties are merchants, then the additional term automatically becomes a part of the contract.
	- ~Special Treatment of Differing Terms.~ If the offeree responds with an acceptance including differing terms, then the applicable rule varies by jurisdiction:
		1. Under the **_knockout rule_** (the majority rule), conflicting terms cancel one another – none of the conflicting terms enter the contract, and the court will supply any missing terms with the UCC’s _gap fillers_, as needed.
			1. If a price is missing, the court will assume a “reasonable price.”
			2. If a place of delivery is missing, the court will assume the buyer must collect the goods from the seller.
			3. If a time for shipment is missing, the court will assume “a reasonable time”.
			4. If a time for payment is missing, the court will assume payment is due when the buyer receives the goods.'
		2. Under the **_first shot rule_** (a minority rule), if the differing terms are the offeror’s terms, then the terms become part of the contract, since the offeror is the “master of the offer.”
		3. Under the **_California rule_** (used by California and a minority of jurisdictions), the court will treat the differing terms as additional terms.
