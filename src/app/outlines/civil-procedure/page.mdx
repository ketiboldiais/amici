# Civil Procedure

## Jurisdiction
- To hear a case, a court must have (1) personal jurisdiction over the defendant[^dodson], (2) subject matter jurisdiction over the case[^r12(h)(3)], and (3) proper venue[^r12(b)(3)].

[^r12(h)(3)]: _See_ ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(h)(3) (if the court determines – at any time – that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action).
[^dodson]: _See_ Scott Dodson, _Plaintiff Personal Jurisdiction and Venue Transfer_, 117 ~Mich. L. Rev.~ 1463, 1470 (2019). _See also_ ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(b)(2) (lack of personal jurisdiction is a defense).
[^r12(b)(3)]: ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(b)(3) (improper venue is a defense).

### Personal Jurisdiction
There are several ways to establish personal jurisdiction.

- __Traditional Basis.__ A court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: (1) the plaintiff personally served the defendant with process within the forum state, or (2) the defendant voluntarily appeared before the court.[^pennoyer]
- __Minimum Contacts Basis.__ A court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: (1) the forum state’s long-arm statute allows personal jurisdiction over the defendant, and (2) if the court exercised jurisdiction over the defendant, the exercise satisfies the _International Shoe_ test.[^international_shoe]
	- __International Shoe Test.__ An exercise of jurisdiction satisfies _International Shoe_ if and only if (1) the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state, and (2) if the defendant has such minimum contacts, the exercise of jurisdiction comports with “fair play and substantial justice.”[^international_shoe_test]
		- __Prong 1: Minimum Contacts.__ A defendant has minimum contacts if she performed actions within or outside the forum state showing (1) the defendant purposefully availed herself of the forum state’s benefits and protections, and (2) because of such actions, the defendant should have foreseen being brought to the forum state’s courts.[^volkswagen_contacts]
		- __Prong 2: Fairness & Justice.__ To determine if an exercise of jurisdiction comports with fair play and substantial justice, a court must consider: (a) the defendant’s burden, (b) the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, (c) the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, (d) the interstate judicial system’s interest in efficiently resolving controversies, and (e) the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social policies.[^burger_king]

<aside>

Under _Pennoyer_, a state—within its borders—has jurisdiction over (a) _people_ and (b) _property_. The former yields personal jurisdiction and the latter in-rem jurisdiction. In-rem jurisdiction is simple for immobile property (e.g., land) but complex for mobile (one could simply move the property out of state before a jurisdiction analysis). The fix is _quasi-in-rem jurisdiction_: by seizing the property while it lay in state, the court obtains jurisdiction. _See_ _Note_, _Quasi in Rem Jurisdiction and Due Process Requirements_, 82 ~Yale L.J.~ 1023, 1024 (1973).

</aside>

- __In-rem Jurisdiction.__ If a property is located within the borders of a court’s forum state, then that court has jurisdiction over claims to that property.[^pennoyer_in_rem]
- __Quasi-in-rem Jurisdiction.__ If a defendant’s property is located within the borders of a court’s forum state and the court seizes such property, then the court has jurisdiction over personal claims to that property, provided the exercise of such jurisdiction satisfies the _International Shoe_ test.[^pennoyer_quasi_in_rem]
