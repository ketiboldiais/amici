# Civil Procedure

## Jurisdiction
- To hear a case, a court must have (1) personal jurisdiction over the defendant[^dodson], (2) subject matter jurisdiction over the case[^r12(h)(3)], and (3) proper venue[^r12(b)(3)].

[^r12(h)(3)]: _See_ ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(h)(3) (if the court determines – at any time – that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action).
[^dodson]: _See_ Scott Dodson, _Plaintiff Personal Jurisdiction and Venue Transfer_, 117 ~Mich. L. Rev.~ 1463, 1470 (2019). _See also_ ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(b)(2) (lack of personal jurisdiction is a defense).
[^r12(b)(3)]: ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(b)(3) (improper venue is a defense).

### Personal Jurisdiction
- There are several ways to establish personal jurisdiction:
	- __Traditional Basis.__ A court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if and only if: (1) the plaintiff personally served the defendant with process within the forum state, or (2) the defendant voluntarily appeared before the court.[^pennoyer]

[^pennoyer]: _See_ _Pennoyer v. Neff_, 95 U.S. (5 Otto) 714 (1877).
