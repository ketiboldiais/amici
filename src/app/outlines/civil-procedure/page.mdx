# Civil Procedure

## Jurisdiction
- To hear a case, a court must have (1) personal jurisdiction over the defendant[^dodson], (2) subject matter jurisdiction over the case[^r12(h)(3)], and (3) proper venue[^r12(b)(3)].

[^r12(h)(3)]: _See_ ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(h)(3) (if the court determines – at any time – that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action).
[^dodson]: _See_ Scott Dodson, _Plaintiff Personal Jurisdiction and Venue Transfer_, 117 ~Mich. L. Rev.~ 1463, 1470 (2019). _See also_ ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(b)(2) (lack of personal jurisdiction is a defense).
[^r12(b)(3)]: ~Civ. Pro. R.~ 12(b)(3) (improper venue is a defense).

### Personal Jurisdiction
There are several ways to establish personal jurisdiction.

- __Traditional Basis.__ A court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: (1) the plaintiff personally served the defendant with process within the forum state, or (2) the defendant voluntarily appeared before the court.[^pennoyer]
- __Minimum Contacts Basis.__ A court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant if: (1) the forum state’s long-arm statute allows personal jurisdiction over the defendant, and (2) if the court exercised jurisdiction over the defendant, the exercise satisfies the _International Shoe_ test.[^international_shoe]
	- __International Shoe Test.__ An exercise of jurisdiction satisfies _International Shoe_ if and only if (1) the defendant has minimum contacts with the forum state, and (2) if the defendant has such minimum contacts, the exercise of jurisdiction comports with “traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.”[^international_shoe_test]
	- __What are minimum contacts?__ A defendant has minimum contacts if she performed actions within or outside the forum state showing (1) the defendant purposefully availed herself of the forum state’s benefits and protections, and (2) because of such actions, the defendant should have foreseen being brought to the forum state’s courts.[^volkswagen_contacts]
- __In-rem Jurisdiction.__ If (1) a case requires a court to determine a property’s title, and (2) the property is located within the borders of the court’s forum state, then the court has personal jurisdiction to enforce its determination against any defendant.[^pennoyer_in_rem]
<aside>
In-rem jurisdiction is restricted to cases concerning _property_.

- __Quasi-in-rem Jurisdiction.__
