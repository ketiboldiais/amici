# Constitutional Law

## The Constitutionâ€™s Functions
### Division of Powers
- The Constitution creates a national government (the federal government) and divides its power between three branches.
	- Article I vests legislative power in Congress.
	- Article II vests executive power in the President.
	- Article III vests judicial power in (1) the Supreme Court, and (2) the inferior courts created by Congress.
- This division of powers is intended to create a system of checks and balances. In general, in order for the government to act, at least two branches must agree.
	1. To adopt a law, the legislature must draft and pass the law; the executive must sign.
	2. To enforce a law, the executive must carry out the law and prosecute violations; the judiciary must convict.
	3. To strike down a law, either the judiciary finds the law unconstitutional or the legislature repeals the law; the executive must ensure the law is no longer enforced.

### Term Limits and Qualifications
- The Constitution specifies how long certain officials may hold office, and their minimum qualifications.
