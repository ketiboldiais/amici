# Contracts
## Applicable Law
* Before analyzing a contract issue, a court must determine which law applies.
* The **_Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)_** governs contracts for the sale of goods.[^ucc_2-102]
	+ A **_good_** is any movable or tangible property at the time such property as identified, excluding money, and including investment securities, unborn young of animals, growing crops, and things attached to realty.[^ucc_2-105(1)]
		- The phrase “things attached to realty” includes minerals and the like (e.g., oil and gas), as well as structures attached to the land the seller will sever.[^ucc_2-107(1)]
[^ucc_2-107(1)]: UCC § 2-107(1).
[^ucc_2-102]: UCC § 2-102.
[^ucc_2-105(1)]: UCC § 2-105(1).
* Common law governs all other contracts.

<aside>
Some common contracts that don’t concern goods: contracts for services, contracts for real property, and marriage contracts (i.e., “prenups”).
</aside>

* If a contract includes both goods and the provision of services, then there are three tests a court may apply, depending on the jurisdiction.
	1. **_Predominant-purpose Test._** Followed by the majority of courts, under the predominant-purpose test, the contract’s purpose as a whole and the law governing that purpose determines the applicable law.[^nanostatics]
	2. **_Gravamen-of-the-action Test._** Followed by a minority of cours, under the gravamen-of-the-action test, Article 2 of the UCC applies to the transaction’s goods aspect if that aspect of the transaction formed the gravamen of the action.[^hawkland_2-102]
	3. **_Final Product Test._** Followed by a minority of courts, under the final product test, Article 2 of the UCC applies if the final product of the transaction is a “good.”[^miller_726-27]

[^nanostatics]: _See_ _Action Grp., Inc. v. NanoStatics Corp._, No. 13AP-72, 2013 WL 6708395 at *8 (Ohio Ct. App. Dec. 17, 2013) (“When presented with a hybrid contract ... the majority of courts follow the predominant-purpose test to determine whether or not the UCC applies.”).

[^miller_726-27]: _See_ Crystal L. Miller, Note, _The Goods/Services Dichotomy and the U.C.C.: Unweaving the Tangled Web_, 59 ~Notre Dame L. Rev.~ 717, 726-27 (1984) (describing the final product test); _see e.g.,_ _Carpel v. Saget Studios, Inc.,_ 326 F. Supp. 1331, 1333 (E.D. Pa. 1971) (holding that a contract for taking wedding photos is a transaction in goods governed by the U.C.C.); _Lake Wales Publ’g. Co. v. Fla. Visitor, Inc.,_  335 So. 2d 335, 336 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976) (holding that the UCC governs a contract to edit and publish pamphlets and other materials because the “items furnished” were “specially produced or manufactured” and the “services rendered were of necessity directed to [the] production of the items”).

## Contract Formation
- A contract consists of an offer, an acceptance, and consideration – if any of these requirements are absent, then no contract exists.[^may_v_anderson]
- An **_offer_** is a manifestation of willingess to enter into a bargain; that is, there must be (1) a demonstration of intent to enter into a contract, (2) definite and certain terms, and (3) a communication to the offeree.[^r_2_c_24]
	- __Intent.__ Courts consider various factors when determining whether intent is present.
		1. __Words & Conduct.__ The offeror’s words or conduct may evidence intent.[^language_intent] To interpret words or conduct, courts use an **_objective standard_** – would a reasonable person interpret these words or conduct as an intent to enter into a contract?[^objective_standard]
		2. __Jokes.__ An offer made as a joke is not a valid offer.[^lucy_v_zehmer]
		3. __Preliminary Negotations.__ A party’s language may invite further discussion or negotiation without indicating an intent to contract.[^robertson_v_volvo]
		4. __Advertisements.__ An advertisement is not an offer.[^calamari_36-37]
			- ~exception~. If a reasonable consumer would understand the advertiser as manifesting a willingness to enter into a bargain, then the advertisement is a valid offer.[^rest_offer_def]. This is often the case when the advertisement states a “clear, definite, and explicit offer, and leaves nothing open for negotation.”[^lefkowitz]
