## Crimes Against the Person
### Battery
- A person is guilty of battery if he intentionally[^johnson_v_us] causes bodily injury[^dauzat] or an offensive touching[^touching] to another.

[^johnson_v_us]: _See_ _Johnson v. United States_, 559 U.S. 133, 139 (2010) (“[T]he common-law crime of battery ... consisted of the intentional application of unlawful force against the person of another”).
[^dauzat]: _See_ _State v. Gordon_, 560 N.W.2d 4 (Iowa 1997) (finding that a bruise on the victim’s skin was not a bodily injury because there was no evidence that the victim suffered pain or illness from the blow).
[^touching]: _See e.g._ _United States v. Bayes_, 210 F.3d 64 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding that deliberately touching a stewardess’s buttocks is an offensive touching); _Wood v. Common Wealth_, 140 S.E. 114 (Va. 1927) (placing one’s hands on another’s bosom is an offensive touching); _Lynch v. Commonwealth_, 109 S.E. 427 (1921) (a black male defendant told a white female victim that he wanted to kiss her; after she refused, the defendant touched her and said he meant not insult and left – the court found the touch an offensive touching); _Weaver v. State_, 146 S.W. 927 (1912) (kissing another without her consent is an offensive touching, but not if her conduct indicates she found it agreeable).

### Assault
- A person is guilty of assault if he (1) intentionally causes another in reasonable apprehension of imminent injury[^harrod], or (2) attempts to commit a battery[^mpc211.1].

[^harrod]: _See_ _Harrod v. S._, 499 A.2d 959 (Md. App. 1985) (threatening another with a gun constitutes an assault). 
[^mpc211.1]: _See_ ~Model Penal Code~ § 211.1 (the Model Penal Code groups assault and battery together under the label “assault”).

### Mayhem
- A person is guilty of mayhem if he permanently dismembers or disables a body part.[^hughes_258]

[^hughes_258]: _See_ ~Thomas W. Hughes~, ~A Treatise on Criminal Law and Procedure~ 258 (1919).

### Kidnapping
- A person is guilty of kidnapping if: (1) he either (a) removes the victim from his place of residence or business, (b) moves the victim a substantial distance from where he is found, or (c) confines the victim for a substantial period in an isolated place; __and__ (2) he does so for at least one of these purposes: (a) to obtain ransom or reward, (b) to use the victim as a shield or hostage, (c) to facilitate a felony or escape, (d) to bodily injure the victim, or (e) to to terrorize the victim.[^mpc_212.1]

[^mpc_212.1]: _See_ ~Model Penal Code~ § 212.1.

### Rape
- A person is guilty of rape if he penetrates[^grubb] – with his penis[^carter] – the vagina of a woman[^shields] (other than his wife[^hale]) without her consent[^blackstone210], through force or threat of force.[^dripps]

[^grubb]: _See_ _State v. Grubb_, 41 P. 951 (Kan. 1895); _State v. Snyder_, 91 P.2d 570 (Wash. 1939).
