# Federal Courts
## Justiciability in Federal Court
- A federal court may hear a dispute only if there is a controversy or case underlying the dispute.
	- This rule prevents federal courts from issuing **_advisory opinions_** – a court’s nonbinding interpretation of the law. 
	- Federal courts are allowed to issue **_declaratory judgments_** – decisions that state the legal effects of a law or party action.
	- __~comment~__. Advisory opinions are available in non-U.S. jurisdictions like Canada. There, legislatures are allowed to ask a court, “Is this proposed law constitutional?” The court’s answer to that question is an advisory opinion.

### Political Question Doctrine 
- A federal court cannot hear issues classified as **_political questions._** Under the **_political question doctrine_**, if a dispute’s issue is “textually committed” to another branch (i.e., the President or Congress), or if there are no manageable standards for a federal court to use to resolve the issue, then the dispute’s issue falls under the political question.
	- __~note~__. A dispute may comprise several issues. The fact that one of the issues implicates the political question doctrine does not mean that the court cannot hear the dispute entirely. The court cannot hear the issue implicating the doctrine, but it may still be able to hear the other issues.

### Standing
- A federal court may hear a dispute only if the plaintiff has **_standing._**
