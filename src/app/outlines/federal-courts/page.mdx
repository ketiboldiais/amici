# Federal Courts

## Judicial Power
- The U.S. Supreme Court is established by the Constitution directly. But, the lower federal courts (i.e., the federal courts of appeal and the federal district courts) are subject to Congress’s power. They are easier to create, but hard to destroy – the only reasonable way for Congress to get rid of a lower court is to wait for its life-tenured positions to expire.[^us-const-art3-sect1]

[^us-const-art3-sect1]: U.S. Const. Art. III, § 1. _The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office._
- From a high-level perspective, the federal courts monitor the executive and legislative branch’s actions by reviewing their constitutionalities (provided a party brings a challenge).[^marbury]
[^marbury]: _See_ _Marbury v. Madison_, 5 U.S. 137 (1803).

<aside>
A common point of debate among constitutional scholars is whether these categories are ceilings or floors. For the vast majority of cases, the categories outlined by Article III, Section 2 are interpreted as ceilings.
</aside>

- Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases:[^us-const-art3-sect2]
	1. implicating the U.S. Constitution,
	2. implicating federal law,
	3. implicating treaties created or to be created by federal law,
	4. affecting ambassadors, public ministers, or consuls,
	5. under admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,
	6. between two or more states,
	7. between a state and citizens of another state,
	8. between citizens of different states,
	9. between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and
	10. between a state or its citizens and foreign states and their citizens.
[^us-const-art3-sect2]: U.S. Const. Art. III, § 2, ¶ 1. _The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;—to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;—to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;—to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;—to controversies between two or more states;— between a state and citizens of another state;—between citizens of different states;—between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects._

## The Supremacy Clause

<aside>
Advisory opinions are available in non-U.S. jurisdictions like Canada. There, legislatures are allowed to ask a court, “Is this proposed law constitutional?” The court’s answer to that question is an advisory opinion.
</aside>

- Federal courts are prohibited from issuing **_advisory opinions_** – a court’s nonbinding interpretation of the law.
	- This rule originates in a letter between George Washington and the U.S. Supreme Court, on August 8, 1793. Confronting the war between France, Great Britain, and Spain, Thomas Jefferson – then the Secretary of State – requested the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion on the nation’s relations with France. The Court declined to answer and addressed President George Washington directly: Because the Court is a court of last resort, the Court will not decide questions extrajudicially.
- Federal courts, however, are allowed to issue **_declaratory judgments_** – decisions that state the legal effects of a law or party action.

## Limitations on the Power to Assign Duties to the Judiciary
- Neither the executive nor the executive branch can assign non-judicial duties to the judiciary.[^hayburn]
[^hayburn]: _Hayburn’s Case_, 2 U.S. 409 (1792).

<Brief title={`Hayburn’s Case, 2 U.S. 409 (1792)`}>

__Facts.__ In 1792, Congress passed the _Invalid Pensions Act_, allowing Revolutionary War veterans to apply for pensions. The Act charged the United States circuit courts – the federal court system’s intermediate courts from 1789 to 1912 – to determine qualified applicants. After determining an applicant qualified, a court would submit the applicant’s name and a recommended amount to the Secretary of War, who would then decide whether to accept or deny the court’s submission. From the U.S. Supreme Court, five of the then-six justices – John Jay, William Cushing, James Wilson, John Blair Jr., and James Iredell – protested. Writing to George Washington, the justices declined to hear applicants and questioned the Act’s constitutionality. During this exchange, William Hayburn, an injured Revolutionary War Veteran, applied for a pension under the Act.

Hayburn submitted his petition to the Circuit Court for Pennsylvania. Taking the U.S. Supreme Court’s position, the circuit court refused to consider Hayburn’s application. In response, U.S. Attorney General Edmund Randolph sent a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court requesting a writ of mandamus: compel the Circuit Court for Pennsylvania to proceed. Randolph subsequently appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court himself without a client – _ex officio_ – arguing that he could move for the writ of mandamus personally under his capacity as attorney general.

__Analysis.__ The Court split 3-3 on whether Randolph could file the writ _ex officio_. They never decide Hayburn’s case.

__Conclusion.__ Despite an explicit decision, the exchanges between the Court, President Washington, and A.G. Randolph led to a long-standing, unwritten rule: Neither Congress nor the President can assign non-judicial duties to the Court.

## Standing
- A federal court may hear a case only if the plaintiff identifies a concrete injury that (a) he has sustained, (b) that the defendant has caused, and (c) that a court can provide legal remedy for.[^allen_v_wright]
	- __Concrete injury.__ The injury must be actual or imminent – it cannot be conjectural or hypothetical.[^lujan]
		<Brief title={`Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972)`}>
		The Sierra Club sued the U.S. Forest Service because its approval of a ski resort in the Sequoia National Forest adversely affected the forest’s aesthetics and ecology, and the Sierra Club had a special interest in preserving forests – the Court found that the Sierra Club suffered no injury in fact.
		</Brief>
		<Brief title={`United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166 (1974)`}>
		Richardson sued the United States, claiming that because the C.I.A. did not account for its expenditures, Richardson could not be an informed voter – the Court found that Richardson suffered no injury in fact, since his grievance was common to all members of the public.
		</Brief>
	- __Causation.__ The injury must be traceable to the defendant’s actions; it cannot be the result of some independent action of a third party not before the court.[^lujan2]
	- __Legal remedy.__ The plaintiff must show that it is likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.[^lujan3]
