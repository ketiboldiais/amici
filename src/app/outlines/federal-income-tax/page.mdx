## The Power to Tax
- The Constitution authorizes Congress to impose and collect taxes.[^art1_sec8_cl1]
- Specifically, the Constitution authorizes Congress to impose and collect _direct taxes_[^art1_sec8_cl3] and _income taxes_[^16th_amd].
	- Congress may impose and collect a direct tax only if the tax is apportioned to each state according to their respective populations.[^art1_sec9_cl4]

[^art1_sec8_cl1]: ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 8, cl. 1.
[^art1_sec8_cl3]: ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 8, cl. 3.
[^art1_sec9_cl4]: ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 9, cl. 4.
[^16th_amd]: ~U.S. Const.~ amd. 16.

## Identifying the Taxpayer

<aside>
The first step in analyzing any given tax problem is to determine who the taxpayer is.
</aside>

### Individuals
- Every individual is potentially a taxpayer: If the individual’s gross income equals or exceeds the filing threshold for their particular filing status and age during the taxable year, then the individual must pay a tax on that gross income.[^pub501]
	- ~corollary~. Whether an individual’s income is taxed for a particular taxable year depends on (1) their filing status, (2) age, and (3) gross income for that year.

[^pub501]: _See_ I.R.C. § 1 (specifying filing statuses, their threshold amounts, and their tax rates). _See also_ IRS [~Here’s Who Needs to File a Tax Return in 2024~](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/heres-who-needs-to-file-a-tax-return-in-2024) (Feb. 2024).

#### Filing Status
- All individual taxpayers fall under one of six filing status:[^irc1]
	1. married filing jointly or a specified surviving spouse;
	2. head of household; 
	3. unmarried individuals (other than specified surviving spouses or heads of houshold);
	4. married filing separately;
	5. children under age 18 with unearned income; and
	6. estates and trusts.

[^irc1]: I.R.C. § 1.

## Gross Income
- The law does not explicitly define “gross income,” but the U.S. Supreme Court has held: Although Congress cannot make a thing income when it is not, Congress can label a thing “income” and tax it, so long as it does so constitutionally.[^murphy_case]
- Unless excluded by law, gross income is “income from whatever source,” realized in any form, including, but not limited to:[^irc61(a)]
	- Under __I.R.C. § 61(a)__:
		- compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items;
		- gross income derived from business;
		- gains derived from dealings in property;
		- interest;
		- rents;
		- royalties;
		- dividends;
		- alimony and separate maintenance payments;
		- annutities
		- income from life insurance and endowment contracts;
		- pensions;
		- income from discharge of indebtedness;
		- distributive share of partnership gross income;
		- income in respect of a decedent; and
		- income from an interest in an estate or trust.
	- Under __26 C.F.R. § 1.61-2(a)__:
		- wages;
		- salaries;
		- salesmen commissions;
		- compensation for services based on profits;
		- commissions on insurance premiums;
		- tips;
		- bonuses;
		- termination or severance pay;
		- rewards;
		- jury fees;
		- marriage fes and other contributions received by a clergyman for services;
		- pay of U.S. military personnel;
		- retired pay of employees;
		- pensions; and
		- retirement allowances.
	- Under __26 C.F.R. § 1.61-2(d)__:
		- If services are paid for in property, the fair market value of the property taken in payment is income.
		- If services are paid for in exchange for other services, the fair market value of such other services taken in payment.
			- If services are rendered at a stipulated price, then the price is presumed to be the fair market value of the compensation received absent evidence to the contrary.
