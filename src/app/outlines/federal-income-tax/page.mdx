## The Power to Tax
- The Constitution authorizes Congress to impose and collect taxes.[^art1_sec8_cl1]
- Specifically, the Constitution authorizes Congress to impose and collect _direct taxes_[^art1_sec8_cl3] and _income taxes_[^16th_amd].
	- Congress may impose and collect a direct tax only if the tax is apportioned to each state according to their respective populations.[^art1_sec9_cl4]

[^art1_sec8_cl1]: ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 8, cl. 1.
[^art1_sec8_cl3]: ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 8, cl. 3.
[^art1_sec9_cl4]: ~U.S. Const.~ art. I, § 9, cl. 4.
[^16th_amd]: ~U.S. Const.~ amd. 16.

## Identifying the Taxpayer

<aside>
The first step in analyzing any given tax problem is to determine who the taxpayer is.
</aside>

### Individuals
- Every individual is potentially a taxpayer: If the individual’s gross income equals or exceeds the filing threshold for their particular filing status and age during the taxable year, then the individual must pay a tax on that gross income.[^pub501]
	- ~corollary~. Whether an individual’s income is taxed for a particular taxable year depends on (1) their filing status, (2) age, and (3) gross income for that year.

[^pub501]: _See_ I.R.C. § 1 (specifying filing statuses, their threshold amounts, and their tax rates). _See also_ IRS [~Here’s Who Needs to File a Tax Return in 2024~](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/heres-who-needs-to-file-a-tax-return-in-2024) (Feb. 2024).

#### Filing Status
- All individual taxpayers fall under one of six filing status:[^irc1]
	1. married filing jointly or a specified surviving spouse;
	2. head of household; 
	3. unmarried individuals (other than specified surviving spouses or heads of houshold);
	4. married filing separately;
	5. children under age 18 with unearned income; and
	6. estates and trusts.

[^irc1]: I.R.C. § 1.
