# Real Property

## Acquiring Land
### Adverse Possession
- A trespasser may acquire land by showing that he: actually possessed (1) the land, (2) in an open and notorious manner, (3) exclusively, (4) adversely to the owner’s interests, and (5) continuously for the number of years determined by statute.[^singer_43]
	- __“actually possessed”__. The trespasser must physically occupy the premises and must show intent to maintain their occupation.[^brumagim]
	- __“open and notorious”__. The trespasser must possess and use the property as if they owned the property.[^marengo]
	- __“exclusively”__. The land’s true owner and the public must be excluded from the land.[^stoebuck]
	- __“adversely to the owner’s interests”__. The trespasser must occupy the land without the owner’s consent.[^hostile]
	- __“continuously”__. The trespasser must possess the land for the duration determined by statute; this varies by state, ranging from five to forty years.[^thompson_87-01]

### Land Sale Contracts
- A **_land sale contract_** is a contract transferring an interest in land for a price.[^black67]
- Under the **_Merger Doctrine_**, a land sale contract governs the land transfer until the time of closing; after the time of closing, the _deed_ governs the land transfer.[^middlekauff]
- Because a land sale contract is a sale for an interest in land, the Statute of Frauds applies.[^rest_k_110]
	- A contract satisfies the Statue of Frauds only if:[^rest_k_131]
		1. the contract is in writing, 
		2. the contract identifies the contract’s subject matter (in this case, a land sale),
		3. the contract indicates who the parties are,
		4. the contract states with reasonable certainty the essential terms relating to any unperformed promises, and
		5. the contract is signed by the parties to be bound.
	- ~exception~. Under the **_Doctrine of Part Performance_**, the Statue of Frauds will not apply to a land sale contract if all the following conditions are met:[^mcclintock]
		1. the purchaser possesses the land,
		2. the purchaser makes substantial improvements to the land, and
		3. the purchaser pays part or all of the purchase price.

- __Covenant of Marketable Title.__ For all land sale contracts, the seller implicitly promises that he will transfer marketable title at closing time.[^sugden] A land has marketable title only if the title is free from reasonable doubt about the seller’s ability to convey the land.[^milhauser]
