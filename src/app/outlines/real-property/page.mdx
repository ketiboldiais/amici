# Real Property

## Acquiring Land
### Adverse Possession
- A trespasser may acquire land by showing that he: actually possessed (1) the land, (2) in an open and notorious manner, (3) exclusively, (4) adversely to the owner’s interests, and (5) continuously for the number of years determined by statute.[^singer_43]
	- __“actually possessed”__. The trespasser must physically occupy the premises and must show intent to maintain their occupation.[^brumagim]
	- __“open and notorious”__. The trespasser must possess and use the property as if they owned the property.[^marengo]
	- __“exclusively”__. The land’s true owner and the public must be excluded from the land.[^stoebuck]
	- __“adversely to the owner’s interests”__. The trespasser must occupy the land without the owner’s consent.[^hostile]
	- __“continuously”__. The trespasser must possess the land for the duration determined by statute; this varies by state, ranging from five to forty years.[^thompson_87-01]

### Land Sale Contracts
- A **_land sale contract_** is a contract transferring an interest in land for a price.[^black67]
- Under the **_Merger Doctrine_**, a land sale contract governs the land transfer until the time of closing; after the time of closing, the _deed_ governs the land transfer.[^middlekauff]
- Because a land sale contract is a sale for an interest in land, the Statute of Frauds (SOF) applies.[^rest_k_110]
