# Torts

## Intentional Torts 
### Battery
- A person is liable for battery if he [intentionally](#proving-intent) inflicts a harmful or offensive bodily contact against another.[^rest_2_18]
	- __Harmful.__ A harmful bodily contact is contact that causes pain or bodily damage, or impairs another’s body in any way.[^rest_3_4]
	- __Offensive.__ An offensive bodily contact is contact that offends a reasonable person’s sense of dignity, unless the victim indicates that such contact is acceptable.[^rest_3_103_a]
		- If the victim has an unusually sensitive sense of personal dignity, then the contact is offensive if the actor intended to offend the victim.[^rest_3_103_b]
		- Some contact with another must be tolerated in society; a contact will not be determined offensive if doing so would violate public policy or be unduly burdensome.[^holt]

### Intent
- A person intentionally commits an act if (1) the defendant has a purpose to achieve the act’s result, or (2) the defendant knows with substantial certainty that the act will cause the result.[^rest_torts_1]
- __Doctrine of Transferred Intent.__ If the defendant intends to commit a tort against one person but (a) commits a different tort against that person or any other person or (b) commits the tort against a different person, then the element of intent is satisfied.[^rest_3_110]
