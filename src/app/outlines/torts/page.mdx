# Torts

## Intentional Torts 
### Proving Intent
- A defendant intentionally commits an act if (1) the defendant has a purpose to achieve the act’s result, or (2) the defendant knows with substantial certainty that the act will cause the result.[^rest_torts_1]
- __Transferred Intent.__ If the defendant intends to commit a tort against one person but (a) commits a different tort against that person or any other person or (b) commits the tort against a different person, then the element of intent is satisfied for the intended tort.[^rest_3_110]
